<h1>RaceDay</h1>
<p>An app for managing 4-lane/-player racing events</p>
<p>Start by dragging a roster .csv onto the webpage. See mammals.csv
as an example of the format. Make sure the By Groups/Altogether radio
option is selected appropriately (with big enough rosters, racers can
  be grouped by age or skill and only race within their group)</p>
<h2>Left Pane</h2>
<p><img src="oneflag.png" height="31"/> Generate a heat schedule where
  each racer gets four heats, once in each lane</p>
<p><img src="twoflags.png" height="31"/> Generate a heat schedule
  where each racer gets eight heats, twice in each lane</p>
<p><img src="arrows_circle.png" height="31"/> After a heat schedule
  has been generated, cycle between three views:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Schedule:</b> the generated heat schedule is displayed. Each
  player has a randomly-assigned color to help find their races. Races
  that have been run and scored are uncolored.</li>
  <li><b>Score:</b> individual results are listed per player, with
  their average score in bold.</li>
  <li><b>CSV:</b> Full state of the roster, schedule, and results; can
  be copy/pasted into a text file and saved as .csv for reloading
  later (by dropping onto a refreshed page)</li>
</ul>
